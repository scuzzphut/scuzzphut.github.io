## Ornament & Crime - 2 Modules

I made 2 of these because when I ordered the PCB and panel from [Pusherman](https://pushermanproductions.com/), I ended up with 2 panels. One had a scratch on it and they sent me another one and told me to keep the scratched one.  When I ordered the parts, I made sure to get two of everything and ordered a second PCB (from Pusherman,of course).

This was my first venture into SMD (aside from soldering an FV-1 in a couple of guitar pedals) but I found it to be pretty straightforward. No doubt the 0805 sized parts helped. I tried experimenting with solder paste, but found that I could do it with my iron and [some thin solder](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07VFZDJX2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) 

I ordered a selection of SMD resistors and capacitors from [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/) and any odball values they didn't have, I ordered in small quantities from ebay. 

The only expensive (and hard to source) part is the DAC8565IAPW high quality digital to analog converter. Thankfully, [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/) will sell these direct (even in ones and twos) and I ended up doing just that. £10 each plus £5 shipping to Scotland. 

There is a note on the Ornament & Crime site about some faffing around required to mount the display and get it sitting right.  I ended up cutting an IC socket in half to get a nice low-profile socket for the display pins. Works quite well.

Both modules fired up and worked first time, but I ran into problems on both with outputs not responding during the calibration routine. On the first one, I really made a hash of it, but eventually got it working.

The second one had the same problem, but was trivial to solve after the adventures with module 1. 

Worth noting - on module 1 , the problem was a DAC pin that was not soldered - fixed by reflowing. On module 2, the problem was a short between two DAC pins - spotted with a magnifiying glass and fixed by removing the solder with some flux and a braid. 

These are great modules and well worth the adventure of building them.
