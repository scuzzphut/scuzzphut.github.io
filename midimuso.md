## Midimuso Octex in Eurorack.

Here's a [Midimuso Octex](https://midimuso.co.uk/index.php/octex/) converted into a Eurorack module.  

It takes a DIN Midi in and provides CV(V/Oct)/Gate/Clock output as well as 5 CCs converted to CV.  

It takes a 12Vdc supply, so it was easy enough to chop a power cable and solder on a DC connector. 

My modules are in a 19" rack so plenty of space at the back.

I designed and ordered a [front panel from JLCPCB](https://oshwlab.com/scuzzphut/midimuso) for it. 

The little black tubes are light pipes so that I can see the board mounted activity LEDs on the front panel. 
I ordered [a length from ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/223205400641), chopped it up and hot glued them in place.
