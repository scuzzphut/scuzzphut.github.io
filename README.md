## DIY Eurorack Projects

This page has links to Eurorack projects I have built, with some notes that may be useful.
Some are panel/pcb kits that I've assembled, some are DIY pcbs that I've designed in DIYLayoutCreator and etched at home and some are custom panel/pcbs ordered from JLCPCB. For the JLCPCB orders, some I have laid out in EasyEDA myself and some are projects by others published in Github. 

**Please note :**
- Particularly on my early modules, I have made poor design decisions. These are noted on each individual page.
- All of my modules are mounted in 19" rack frames (using Behringer Eurorack racks) where depth is not an issue.
- I have generally opted for low HP modules to save rack space, at the expense of increased depth. This means that many jacks and potentiometers are right-angled, side mounting.
