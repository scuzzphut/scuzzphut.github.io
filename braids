If you have a problem with your Bluepill not working after flashing the Braids.hex file from Soundforce, then you might be missing the bootloader.


Download the Braids bootloader Hex file from here 

https://github.com/hadesbox/eurorack-with-binaries/tree/master/build/braids_bootloader

Then : 

Hook up to USB with one of [these USB programmers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32650897782.html?spm=a2g0o.store_pc_allProduct.8148356.2.4cfe7fa8uE16Xa&pdp_npi=2%40dis%21GBP%21%EF%BF%A11.26%21%EF%BF%A11.26%21%21%21%21%21%400b0a050b16563199459717993e3303%2159712037485%21sh) 

Connect the programmer to the Bluepill according to this diagram
